# Project 6: Around The U.S. (Part Three)
=======

### Overview

Around The U.S. (Part Three) is the sixth project in the Practicum by Yandex Professional Web Developer Certificate Program.


### Description

This project makes use of the following technologies:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3 (including BEM naming conventions and file structure)
3. JavaScript

The website is fully resonsive and it's appearance corresponds (within a margin of error of 30px) with these design files[Project 4](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1).
[Project 5](https://www.figma.com/file/avLHzpJw2dmU2NaDATZ6CX/Sprint-5%3A-Around-The-U.S.-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1).
[Project 6](https://www.figma.com/file/KUbYgXnYElfzxCbcrlsOCE/Sprint-6%3A-Around-The-U.S.?node-id=0%3A1).

The website is deployed on [Github Pages](https://jimiryquai.github.io/around_the_us/).


### Deployment & System Requirements

The project doesn't rely on any plugins or a particular build process at all. In fact, that's probably one area where it could and maybe should be improved - perhaps by adding an npm scripts-based build process that concatenates and compresses the css files.


### Plans For Improvement

1. Add the ability for the browser to 'remember' your changes to the page
2. Add a 'backend' that would facilitate the above. Probably using Node.
